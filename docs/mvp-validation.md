# MVP validation

Record of the checks run on the initial import (commit `01a73eb`) before the
real-use trial. Environment: Linux 6.18, 4 cores, Go 1.25.0, git 2.43.0.

## Hook contract vs. current docs

Checked against the Claude Code hooks reference (`UserPromptSubmit`) and the
Cursor hooks docs (`beforeSubmitPrompt`) on 2026-09-27. No discrepancies:

- **Claude Code.** `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` blocks the prompt and
  erases it from context. `reason` is shown to the user and not added to
  context. `suppressOriginalPrompt: true` hides the original text in the block
  message, which is why the failure message repeats it. Plain stdout on exit 0
  *is* added to Claude's context, so pass-through must print nothing.
- **Cursor.** Input has `conversation_id`, `generation_id`, `workspace_roots`
  and `prompt`. Output is `{"continue":bool,"user_message":…}`.

## End-to-end (built binary, fixtures piped through `jot hook`)

Throwaway `$JOT_DB`. Capture fixtures had `cwd` / `workspace_roots` rewritten
to this checkout, or to a non-git temp dir, with `jq`. These runs were made in
a clone of `kacxx/Claude_Code_Scratch_Pad`, where the code was first pushed by
mistake before moving here, so that is the repo and branch the captures record.

## Latency

Measured by spawning the binary with the fixture on stdin, from Python
`subprocess.run`, so the numbers include process spawn.

| Path | Runs | Median | p95 | Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hook claude`, ordinary prompt | 300 | 3.13 ms | 3.91 ms | 9.54 ms |
| `hook cursor`, ordinary prompt | 300 | 3.28 ms | 4.16 ms | 6.27 ms |
| `hook claude`, capture (git + SQLite insert) | 100 | 10.85 ms | 12.86 ms | 15.14 ms |
| `/bin/true` (baseline) | 300 | 1.02 ms | 1.22 ms | 3.02 ms |

On the ordinary-prompt path, jot adds about 2 ms over a bare process start.
`strace -f -e trace=execve,openat` on that path shows no `git` exec and no
database file opened. With an unwritable `$JOT_DB`, an ordinary prompt still
produces no output and creates nothing.

## Found after import

A later `-race` run of `TestConcurrentWriterPools` failed 2 times in 30. When
several processes open a database file that doesn't exist yet, switching it to
WAL can return `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately, without calling the busy handler. The
failure was safe: the hook still blocked the jot and reported "NOT saved". It
could only happen the first time the database file was created. Fixed after the
import: `Open` retries, giving each attempt only what is left of the busy
timeout so the total wait stays within it, and the schema is created under
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. `TestOpenHonoursBusyTimeout` covers the bound. `TestConcurrentFirstOpen` covers it and failed 4 of 5
runs without the fix.
