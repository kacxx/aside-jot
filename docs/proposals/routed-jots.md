# Routed jots (#30): design proposal

Status: proposal for review. No code until approved.

Built from issue #30, its 4 Oct review comment and docs/decisions.md.
Where this proposal follows that comment, it says so. Revised after the
review on PR #54.

## Summary

A jot that starts with a registered route (`jira: …`, `slack: …`) is tagged
with that route at capture. A worker lists open items for its route and closes
them with `aside done <id> --note <link>`. aside never calls Jira or Slack, has
no claiming, and has no LLM. Confirmation of outward actions is the user's
control, and aside can't enforce it (decision 5).

## Decisions

**1. Routes live in a config file next to the database** (`routes` file, one
route name per line). Not an environment variable: the hook runs in whatever
environment the editor gives it, the same problem that ruled out a tag allowlist
in "Ticket keys are matched at query time". `aside paths` prints where the file
is. Names are lower-case words (`[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*`); a line that doesn't fit,
and the reserved names `any` and `none` (decision 4), are ignored with a
warning from `aside paths`, not from the hook. Blank lines and `#` comments are
skipped. If the file is missing, nothing is routed and everything behaves as
today. This settles where the list lives (issue #30's open question 2) and the
format is plain names; this doc's open question 2 asks only about a richer
format later.

**2. The route is fixed at capture.** It is stored in the existing `metadata`
JSON (`route`), in normal form (lower case, so `Jira:` stores `jira`), so there
is no schema change and no migration. Registering `todo` next month doesn't
queue old `todo:` jots, and removing a route doesn't orphan queued ones.

Matching: the text must start with `name:` and a space, then more text, and
`name` (case-insensitive) must be in the file. Anything else is ordinary text:
`todo:`, a typo, a bare `jira:`, and `jira:SUP-1` with no space after the colon,
which people will type. The stored text is unchanged (the `jira:` prefix stays).

This knowingly goes against "Ticket keys are matched at query time, not
tagged": a route fixed at capture has the same silent-miss failure. If the file
is missing when a jot is captured, the jot never routes, and there is no write
command to fix it later. The fix-at-capture choice is still right for the
`todo` reason above, so the misses are made visible instead:
- The hook reply shows the route: `✓ Jotted #41 → jira`. A `jira:` jot without
  the arrow is noticed straight away.
- The file is read only after `capture.Match` succeeds, so ordinary prompts
  don't pay for it. If it exists but can't be read, the jot is saved unrouted,
  the hook still exits 0, and the reply says `(routes file unreadable)` after
  the id, so the miss is seen at the time.

**3. Provenance is a signal, not a security boundary.** An agent with a shell
can forge either source: `aside add "jira: …"` (or `env -u CLAUDECODE aside
add …`), or `echo '{…}' | aside hook claude`. So:
- Hook captures from `claude` and `codex` route. `cursor` doesn't: Cursor is
  parked ([cursor.md](../cursor.md)) and nothing new is built for it.
- `aside add` does not route. This stops an agent that runs `aside add
  "jira: …"` innocently. It doesn't stop a deliberate one, which can pipe
  into the hook.
- Confirmation (decision 5) is the only control either way. The docs say the
  source check is not a boundary. This doc's open question 1 asks whether
  excluding `add` is worth it.

**4. Worker API stays minimal.**
- `aside inbox --route jira` filters the inbox to that route. `--route any`
  means every routed jot and `--route none` means unrouted ones. `inbox`
  already lists only open jots, and the filter keeps that. Same filter on the
  MCP `inbox` tool, which stays read-only.
- `aside show` prints a `route:` line, and the MCP `inbox`, `show`, `search`
  and `find` results carry a `route` field. CLI list lines (`inbox`, `search`,
  and the loose jots in `find`) don't change: the text already begins with
  `jira:`.
- Closing is the existing `aside done <id>... [--note "why"]` (#43). A worker
  passes the result link as `--note <link>`. No new write command. The note
  must be passed with the flag: `aside done 1 <link>` fails, as `<link>` is
  read as an id.
- No claiming, lease or timeout. Add one only if an item is processed twice.
- No `abandoned` state. `done` with no note already means it (per the review).
  Add one only if abandoned items need reporting.

**5. Confirmation is the worker's contract, not code in aside.** The docs
state: a worker may only draft; the user confirms every Slack post, Jira ticket
or other outward action, every time. Jot text often holds pasted tickets or
logs, so a worker with write access acting unconfirmed is the prompt-injection
path. aside can't enforce this, so the docs won't claim it does.

**6. Routed jots still show in `aside inbox`**, unchanged:
`#41   today  jira: SUP-4821 needs a backend ticket  [aside-jot@main]`. They
stay in the user's own view, and `--route none` shows what isn't routed. No
new bracket marker: the text already starts with the route, and the trailing
`[…]` already means the location. The cost is deliberate: a jot typed with
`aside add`, or captured while the file was missing, prints like a routed one
but no worker will see it. `aside inbox --route none` is how to find those.

**7. `gh` route.** `aside promote` stays a command the user runs, and it asks
`[y/N]` unless `--yes` is passed (#45). `--yes` exists for scripts and is
required when stdin isn't a terminal, so an agent with a shell can pass it. The
`gh` route is therefore an exception to "the user confirms every outward
action", and the docs say so rather than claim `promote` always asks. Whether
`--yes` should go away once `gh` is a route is left out of this design: it
changes #45's decision, so it needs its own entry.

## Out of scope

Jira and Slack workers (they live outside the repo, as examples), aside calling
any service, and claiming.

## Rough size

One PR: route parsing in `internal/capture` (pure function, table tests like
`Match`), reading the `routes` file in `internal/app` after a match, the route
in the hook reply, `--route` on `inbox` plus the MCP tool, a `route` field in
`show`, `search`, `find` and MCP, `aside paths` printing the file, docs and a
decisions.md entry. Hook gating, `done` and the schema are untouched.

## Open questions

1. Is "`aside add` never routes" worth it? It stops accidental agent jots, not
   deliberate ones, and it costs the user routing from their own terminal.
   Confirmation is the only control either way, so this is about convenience:
   is stopping the accidental case worth losing terminal routing?
2. Richer route file format later (for example `jira = SUP-`)? Nothing here
   needs it, so this proposal starts with plain names. Say if you want more now.
3. Timing: the issue comment says to revisit in late October after a few weeks of
   using `find` and `sessions`. Approve the design now and build then, or wait?
