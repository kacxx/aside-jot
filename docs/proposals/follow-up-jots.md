# Follow-up jots when closing a jot (#95): proposal

Status: **decided**. Sliced into #97, #98, #99 and #102 (D9's CLI fix, split out of #98).
Source: #95

Decisions D1 to D9 come from the grill on #95 (2026-10-14), recorded in the issue body. D10 to D15 come from a second grill on the review comment on #95 (2026-10-14).

## Problem

When "update jot N" finds the jot done but leaves work behind, that work ends up only in the `done --note`. The jot then leaves the inbox, and nothing brings the follow-up back.

Example (2026-10-14): a jot asking for a staging test key was done, but the test the key was for was still blocked on access. The agent put the blocker in the suggested `--note` and told the user to type a new `>>` jot if they wanted a reminder. It can't create jots itself, by design.

## Decisions

### D1: When to offer a follow-up

The agent offers a follow-up only when the records show open work that nothing else tracks (no Jira ticket, PR or other open jot covers it). A follow-up that duplicates a ticket is just more inbox noise.

### D2: Partly done jots

When the work is partly done, the agent offers both keeping the jot open and closing it with a follow-up, and the user picks.

### D3: Follow-up wording

The text reads `follow-up to #<id>: <the open work>`, written by the agent in its own words. Naming the source jot keeps the link to the session through `aside show <id>`. Own words keep it short and stop transcript text from being copied into a command.

### D4: Safe command form

The offered command passes the text through stdin with a quoted heredoc, not as an argument:

```
/full/path/to/aside add <<'EOF'
follow-up to #29: <the open work>
EOF
```

Inside `<<'EOF'` nothing expands, so running the command can't execute anything hidden in the text.

### D5: `aside add --from <id>`

Not tracked for now. Naming the jot (D3) is enough until there's evidence the missing session link matters.

### D6: Command order and note

The `aside add` line comes before the `aside done` line, and the done note ends in "; follow-up added as a new jot". Adding first means the follow-up exists before the original leaves the inbox.

### D7: "Update all"

Each follow-up line sits under its jot's done line and doesn't count toward the 10-session limit. The limit is about reading transcripts, and a follow-up costs no extra reads.

### D8: Run from the original repo

The offered command first `cd`s to the source jot's repo root (from `aside show <id>`), so the follow-up is listed under the same repo. It is left out if that folder no longer exists. Otherwise the follow-up records whatever folder the user runs it from.

### D9: Windows command form

On Windows, the agent offers a single-quoted here-string piped into aside instead of a heredoc:

```powershell
@'
follow-up to #29: <the open work>
'@ | & 'C:\path\to\aside.exe' add
```

A single-quoted here-string expands nothing, as with D4. This issue also includes the CLI fix that strips a leading BOM from `aside add`'s stdin, so Windows follow-ups don't start with a stray character.

### D10: Run `done` only if `add` succeeded

The offered command makes `aside done` depend on `aside add` succeeding: on macOS and Linux, they're chained with `&&` on the heredoc's first line, and on Windows, the `done` line is wrapped in `if ($?) { … }`. `$?` is used, not `$LASTEXITCODE`, because `$LASTEXITCODE` is not updated when `aside.exe` can't be started, so a stale 0 would let `done` run (confirmed on Windows PowerShell 5.1.19041, 2026-10-15). This stops the original closing with "follow-up added as a new jot" when no follow-up was added.

### D11: A "partly done" verdict

A fourth verdict, "partly done", sits next to done, no sign yet and can't tell, in both "Updating a jot" and "Updating all jots". It's clearer than a sub-case, and step 5 offers D2's two choices for it.

### D12: No status checks for follow-up jots

"Update" doesn't read the original jot's records for a jot that starts with "follow-up to #N:", for now. The skill says follow-up jots are left out of "Updating all jots" because they have no session. This is the cost D5 already accepted, and nobody has missed it yet.

### D13: How the agent checks D1

Before offering a follow-up, the agent searches the inbox for the open work and checks the records for a ticket or PR that covers it. One sentence in step 5 gives D1 a concrete check.

### D14: No subshell

The command keeps the plain `cd` and `Set-Location`. Ending up in the repo folder is harmless, and a subshell around a heredoc makes the command harder to read.

### D15: The command form still follows aside's path

The rule based on aside's path stays, and Git Bash is listed as a known risk in the proposal. Detecting the user's actual shell adds complexity for an edge case.

## Shape

**Skill (`skills/aside/SKILL.md`):**
- "Updating a jot", step 3: add the fourth verdict, "partly done" (D11).
- "Updating a jot", step 5: before offering a follow-up, search the inbox for the open work and check the records for a ticket or PR that covers it (D13). When the records show open work and nothing else tracks it (D1), offer the follow-up command before the `aside done` line (D6). The follow-up text is `follow-up to #<id>: <the open work>` in the agent's words (D3), and the done note ends in "; follow-up added as a new jot" (D6).
- For a "partly done" verdict, offer two options: keep it open, or close it with the follow-up (D2, D11).
- "Updating all jots": the "partly done" verdict is used here too (D11). Each follow-up line goes under its jot's done line and doesn't count toward the 10 sessions (D7). Say that follow-up jots are left out because they have no session (D12).
- "Things to leave to the user" is unchanged: the agent never runs `aside add` itself.

**Command form.** The agent picks the form from the full path to aside it already uses: a path ending in `.exe` or starting with a drive letter gets the Windows form (D15).

macOS and Linux (D4, D8, D10, D14):

```
cd '<repo root>' && /full/path/to/aside add <<'EOF' && /full/path/to/aside done 29 --note "<evidence>; follow-up added as a new jot"
follow-up to #29: <the open work>
EOF
```

If the `cd` or the `add` fails, `done` doesn't run (probed in zsh and bash).

Windows (D9, D8, D10, D14):

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath '<repo root>'
@'
follow-up to #29: <the open work>
'@ | & 'C:\path\to\aside.exe' add
if ($?) { & 'C:\path\to\aside.exe' done 29 --note "<evidence>; follow-up added as a new jot" }
```

Defaults the decisions leave to the implementer:
- The repo root is the `root:` line of `aside show <id>` on the CLI, or the `repo_root` field of the MCP `show` tool, which the skill reads first. If the jot has no repo root, or the folder no longer exists, the `cd` / `Set-Location` line is left out, and on macOS and Linux the chain starts at `aside add` (D8).
- A repo root containing a single quote is also left out, rather than escaped.
- On Windows the follow-up text is plain ASCII (no curly quotes or em dashes). What Windows PowerShell 5.1 sends to a native program depends on the user's `$OutputEncoding`: the default is ASCII, which turns other characters into `?`. ASCII text arrives intact under any setting. A piped here-string arrives with a leading BOM under both the default and UTF-8, which the CLI change below strips.

**CLI (`cmd/aside/main.go`, `add`):** when the text comes from stdin, strip one leading U+FEFF before `Capture` (D9). Tests in `cmd/aside/main_test.go`: stdin `"\ufeffbom jot\r\n"` is stored as `bom jot`, and stdin that is only a BOM is treated as empty, like empty stdin. Text given as arguments is unchanged. This change doesn't depend on the skill changes and can ship first.

## Out of scope

- `aside add --from <id>` (D5).
- Any MCP server change: the agent offers commands; it gets no write tool.
- Changing how the existing `aside done --note "<evidence>"` line is quoted (see Risks).
- A hook payload that starts with a BOM, reported on #77 as passing through uncaptured. Hosts don't normally send one.

## Risks

- **The existing `--note` is double-quoted.** The skill already offers `aside done <id> --note "<the evidence>"`, and the evidence is drawn from the transcript, so a `$(…)` in it would run when the user runs the command. D4 protects the new `add` line; the `done` line has the same exposure today. Worth its own issue.
- **Terminator lines.** A follow-up line that is exactly `EOF` would end the heredoc early, and on Windows a line starting with `'@` (or a curly `’@`, since PowerShell treats curly quotes as quotes) would end the here-string. A one-line follow-up in the agent's words makes this unlikely.
- **Non-ASCII on Windows.** What reaches aside depends on the user's `$OutputEncoding`: under Windows PowerShell 5.1's default ASCII, any non-ASCII character becomes `?`. Shape keeps the Windows text ASCII, which arrives intact under any setting. PowerShell 7 defaults to UTF-8 and is unaffected.
- **Git Bash on Windows (D15).** The agent picks the form from aside's path, so a Git Bash user gets the PowerShell form and has to adapt it.
- **`Set-Location` failing on Windows.** The `$?` check (D10) covers `aside add`, not `Set-Location`. If the folder can't be entered, the follow-up is still added, from whatever folder the user is in.
- **"Tracked elsewhere" is the agent's call (D1).** It can miss a ticket and offer a duplicate follow-up. The user approves every `add`, so the cost is one extra jot.
