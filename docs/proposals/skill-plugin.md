# A Claude Code plugin for the aside skill (#110): proposal

Status: **decided**. Ready to merge, then slice into tickets.
Source: #110

Decisions D1 to D7 come from the grill on #110 (2026-10-15), recorded in [the decisions comment](https://github.com/kacxx/aside-jot/issues/110#issuecomment-6187065673). D7 was revised the same day, after this doc's fact-check found its premise wrong. The owner's review of PR #112 revised D4's wording and D7 again, and added D8 and D9. Question 3 in the issue (what happens to `aside setup claude`) no longer applies: under D4 the plugin carries no hook or MCP server.

## Problem

The aside skill (`skills/aside/SKILL.md`) has no way to reach users. Most of 0.4.0 is skill-only (follow-up jots, the Windows form, the "partly done" verdict, safe done notes: #104, #106), but someone who downloads 0.4.0 gets only the binary change (#107). The skill on the owner's machine was copied into `~/.claude/skills/aside/` by hand.

The skill isn't embedded in the binary, the release archive holds the binary and `README.md` only, and until #111 the README didn't mention the skill. 0.4.0 shipped with #111's manual-copy section as the stopgap (D3).

## Decisions

### D1: The channel
A Claude Code plugin, with this repo as its own marketplace (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, as dev-flow does it), plus a README section covering a manual copy for anything the plugin doesn't reach. One plugin covers both the terminal and Claude Desktop's Claude Code sessions, and `claude plugin update` keeps it current.

### D2: Hosts in scope now
Now: Claude Code in the terminal and in Claude Desktop, both through the plugin. Codex gets a README line saying to copy or symlink `skills/aside/` into `~/.agents/skills/`, which works because it's the same format. Later, as separate issues if anyone asks: a Codex plugin, a Cursor plugin, and claude.ai account skills for Cowork and the phone. It covers where aside is actually used today, at almost no cost.

### D3: 0.4.0 doesn't wait
Ship 0.4.0 now with a one-line README stopgap ("copy `skills/aside/` into `~/.claude/skills/aside/`"), and the plugin comes in the next release. The plugin is a few tickets of work, and 0.4.0 also carries the byte order mark fix, which needn't wait.

### D4: What the plugin carries (revised 2026-10-15)
The skill only, for now, while `aside setup` keeps installing the hook and printing the MCP server command. Bundling the binary, hook and MCP server into the plugin becomes its own issue (#113): one install for Claude Code, through a launcher that downloads and checks the matching release binary. It gives the low-friction install without putting launcher, Windows and coexistence work into this release.

The skill only, for now, while `aside setup` keeps installing the hook and MCP server. Bundling the binary, hook and MCP server into the plugin becomes its own issue: one install for Claude Code, through a launcher that downloads and checks the matching release binary. It gives the low-friction install without putting launcher, Windows and coexistence work into this release.

Reason: wording only. `aside setup` installs the hook and prints the MCP server command; it doesn't install the MCP server (owner's review of PR #112).
</details>

### D5: Keeping versions in step
release-please bumps `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` through `extra-files`, in the same release PR as the binary, so the plugin and the binary always share a version number. Every release then updates both, and `claude plugin update` picks it up.

### D6: Names
The plugin is `aside` and the marketplace is `aside-jot`, so it installs with `/plugin marketplace add kacxx/aside-jot` and `/plugin install aside@aside-jot`. They match the skill's name and the repo's.

### D7: Without aside installed (revised 2026-10-15)
The plugin's description and the README say it needs aside installed and `aside setup claude` run, since that hook is what records the jots. Adding the MCP server (the command `aside setup claude --mcp` prints) is recommended: reads go through read-only tools instead of shell commands, and the tool descriptions give the full path to aside for `done` and `add`. Without it, `aside` must be on `PATH`. The skill changes by one clause: where it says to use the full path to aside from the tool descriptions, it adds "or `aside` if the MCP tools aren't listed".

Without it, `aside` must be on `PATH`. The skill itself doesn't change.

Reason: the owner's review of PR #112 found the skill's "done" step points at a full path from the tool descriptions, which don't exist without the MCP server (`SKILL.md:58-59`).
</details>

<details><summary>Superseded (2026-10-15, first revision)</summary>

The plugin's description and the README say it needs aside installed and `aside setup claude --mcp` run first. The skill itself doesn't change. The skill does nothing without aside's MCP tools, so saying so up front saves a confusing first run.

Reason: the fact-check found the skill falls back to the CLI without the MCP tools (`SKILL.md:26-28`), and `aside setup claude --mcp` only prints the MCP command, it doesn't run it.
</details>

### D8: What a new install gets
The last release. The plugin entry is a `github` source with `ref` set to the release tag (`vX.Y.Z`), bumped by release-please through `extra-files`. No workflow change, no extra branch.

### D9: A skill newer than the binary
The plugin description and README state a minimum aside version, raised whenever the skill starts needing a newer binary.

## Shape

**`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: `name: "aside"` (D6), `version` set to the current release when it's added (`0.4.0`) and bumped by release-please from then on (D5), a `description` saying what the skill does and what it needs (D7, D9), `author`, and `repository`. No `skills` list: the default `skills/` scan finds `skills/aside`. No `license` field, since the repo has no licence file.

**`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**: `name: "aside-jot"` (D6), `owner`, a `description` (the validator warns without one), and one plugin entry:

```json
{
  "name": "aside",
  "description": "<what the skill does>. Needs aside 0.4.0 or later, with `aside setup claude` run.",
  "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "kacxx/aside-jot", "ref": "v0.4.0" }
}
```

The catalog comes from the default branch; the plugin's files come from the tag (D8). The entry carries the requirements too, because before install Claude Code shows only an entry's own fields for a `github` source. The entry sets no `version`: `plugin.json` at the tag supplies it. Until the first release that contains `plugin.json`, the tag has none and Claude Code uses the commit SHA as the version. Installed, the skill shows as `aside:aside`.

**`release-please-config.json`**: the `.` package gets

```json
"extra-files": [
  { "type": "json", "path": ".claude-plugin/plugin.json", "jsonpath": "$.version" },
  { "type": "json", "path": ".claude-plugin/marketplace.json", "jsonpath": "$.plugins[0].source.ref" }
]
```

so the release PR bumps the plugin's version and its tag with the binary (D5, D8). The updater replaces only the version number inside the string, so `v0.4.0` becomes `v0.5.0`.

**Minimum aside version (D9)**: starts at 0.4.0, since the skill's Windows follow-up form pipes a here-string that can carry a byte order mark, and only 0.4.0's `add` strips it (#107). It appears in the marketplace entry's description, `plugin.json`'s description and the README, and is raised by hand in the PR that makes the skill need a newer binary.

**The skill (D7)**: step 5 of "Updating a jot" gets the clause "or `aside` if the MCP tools aren't listed" where it names the full path from the tool descriptions. The later mentions of the full path ("Updating all jots", the rules) follow it. The Windows form is chosen from the full path today (a path ending in `.exe` or starting with a drive letter); with no full path, the implementer's default is to choose it when the shell is PowerShell.

**A version test**: a Go test in `cmd/aside` (CI already runs `go test ./...`) checks that `plugin.json`'s `version` equals the `.` entry of `.release-please-manifest.json`, and that the marketplace entry's `ref` is `v` plus the same version. A wrong `jsonpath` or a moved file then fails CI instead of silently stopping plugin updates.

**README**: the "Teach your agent the jot routines" section (#111) leads with the plugin for Claude Code, in the terminal and in Desktop:

```text
/plugin marketplace add kacxx/aside-jot
/plugin install aside@aside-jot
```

with `claude plugin update aside@aside-jot` to update, and what it needs: aside 0.4.0 or later installed and `aside setup claude` run, with the MCP server recommended (D7, D9). It keeps the manual copy for Codex (`~/.agents/skills/`) and anything else the plugin doesn't reach (D1, D2), and tells anyone who copied the skill into `~/.claude/skills/aside` by hand to remove that copy when they install the plugin. The sentence "It needs the MCP server above" changes to match D7, and the "planned (#110)" sentence goes.

Nothing in the Go code (apart from the test), `aside setup` or the release archive changes (D4).

## Fact-check

Probes ran on 2026-10-15 at `7825248` (the 0.4.0 release commit): `claude plugin validate` on scratch copies, a headless `claude -p --plugin-dir` session, and installs into a throwaway config directory (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` under `/tmp`). The owner's own Claude Code config was not touched.

| Claim | Result | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The skill isn't embedded in the binary | ✅ no `go:embed` and no `skills` path in any Go file | `grep -rn 'go:embed'`, `grep -rln '"skills'` over `*.go` |
| The release archive holds the binary and `README.md` only | ✅ | `.goreleaser.yaml:23-24` |
| `aside setup` writes the binary's absolute path into the hook config | ✅ | `README.md:59-62`; `internal/setup/binary.go` `Resolve` |
| D4: `aside setup` installs the hook and prints the MCP server command | ✅ | `README.md:59-65` |
| A repo can be its own marketplace with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` (D1) | ✅ sample manifests validate, with a `"./"` entry and with a `github` entry | probe: `claude plugin validate --strict` |
| The default `skills/` scan finds `skills/aside` with no `skills` list | ✅ the session lists `aside:aside`, and the control run without the plugin lists none; the installs put `skills/aside/SKILL.md` in the cache | probe: `claude -p … --plugin-dir <copy> --setting-sources project`; install probes |
| With a `"./"` entry, a new install gets the default branch, whatever `version` says | ✅ a GitHub marketplace's `ref` defaults to the default branch, a relative source resolves from the marketplace's files, and `version` only decides whether an existing install updates | [marketplace reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/marketplace-reference) (marketplace sources, relative path source); [host a marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/host-marketplace) (release a new version) |
| A `github` source with `ref` installs that ref, not the default branch (D8) | ✅ `ref: v0.3.0` installed `fc46c8c` (the `v0.3.0` commit) while `main` was `7825248` | install probe; `git rev-parse v0.3.0^{commit}` |
| A tag without `plugin.json` still installs, versioned by commit SHA | ✅ `ref: v0.4.0` installed with version `7825248b0452` | install probe; `installed_plugins.json` in the throwaway directory |
| Before install, Claude Code shows only the entry's own fields for a non-relative source | ✅ docs | [marketplace reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/marketplace-reference) (how an entry combines with plugin.json) |
| release-please's JSON updater keeps a `v` prefix (D8) | ✅ it replaces only the version-number match inside the string | [`src/updaters/generic-json.ts`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/src/updaters/generic-json.ts) (`replace(VERSION_REGEX, …)`) |
| Release tags are `v`-prefixed | ✅ `v0.4.0`, `v0.3.0` | `gh release list` |
| release-please's `extra-files` bumps a JSON field named by `jsonpath` (D5, D8) | ✅ docs and source | [customizing.md, extra-files](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/docs/customizing.md); `generic-json.ts` |
| release-please here has no extra files yet | ✅ `release-type: go`, one `.` package | `release-please-config.json` |
| D5: "Every release then updates both, and `claude plugin update` picks it up" | ⚠️ partly: `claude plugin update` updates the skill only; the binary updates separately. D9 covers the gap, so nothing depends on the wording | `claude plugin --help`; README install section |
| The 0.4.0 skill needs the 0.4.0 binary on Windows (D9's starting value) | ✅ `add` strips a byte order mark from stdin since #107 | `cmd/aside/main.go:164` |
| CI runs the Go tests | ✅ | `.github/workflows/ci.yml:46`, `:52` |
| `marketplace.json` wants a `description` | ✅ warning without one, error under `--strict` | probe: `claude plugin validate --strict` |
| The repo's `CLAUDE.md` at the plugin root isn't loaded by the plugin | ✅ a warning when the plugin directory is validated, so `--strict` fails there; validating the marketplace with a `github` entry doesn't check the plugin's files | probe: `claude plugin validate --strict .` |
| Installing copies the whole plugin source, not just the skill | ✅ dev-flow's cache holds `docs/`, `evals/`, `scripts/` and `CLAUDE.md`; aside-jot is 90 files, about 1.3 MB | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/dev-flow/dev-flow/0.11.0/`; `git ls-files` |
| dev-flow is built this way and installs with `/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install …@…` | ✅ installed at user scope on the owner's machine | `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json:24-27`; `kacxx/dev-flow` `.claude-plugin/` |
| `claude plugin update <plugin>` updates a plugin (D1, D5) | ✅ | `claude plugin --help` |
| Setting `version` pins the plugin until it changes, so each release's bump is what delivers an update (D5) | ✅ | [plugins reference, `version`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) |
| Claude Desktop's local and SSH Claude Code sessions load plugins from configured marketplaces; cloud sessions and WSL don't; Cowork uses the claude.ai account's skills (D1, D2) | ✅ docs, not probed in Desktop | [Desktop docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop) |
| Codex reads the same `SKILL.md` format (`name`, `description`) from `~/.agents/skills` (D2) | ✅ docs; the skill's front matter has both fields | [Codex skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills); `skills/aside/SKILL.md:1-3` |
| 0.4.0 shipped with the README stopgap (D3) | ✅ #111 merged 08:13Z, v0.4.0 released 08:13Z on 2026-10-15 | `gh pr view 111`; `gh release list` |
| First superseded D7: "The skill does nothing without aside's MCP tools" | ❌ the skill says that without the MCP tools it runs the same commands through the CLI (`aside inbox`, `aside show`, …); D7 revised | `skills/aside/SKILL.md:26-28` |
| First superseded D7: running `aside setup claude --mcp` gives the agent the MCP tools | ❌ `--mcp` prints the command that adds the MCP server; it doesn't run it; D7 revised | `README.md:64-65` |
| Second superseded D7: the skill works unchanged without the MCP server | ❌ the "done" step uses "the full path to aside from the tool descriptions"; D7 revised | `SKILL.md:58-59` (owner's review of PR #112) |
| D7: `aside setup claude` adds the hook that records the jots | ✅ it adds the `UserPromptSubmit` hook | `README.md:59`; `cmd/aside/main.go:67-68` |
| D7: the MCP server's tools are read-only, and `done` and `add` go through the shell | ✅ | `SKILL.md:14`, `SKILL.md:58-59`; `internal/mcp/server.go:248` |
| D7: the MCP tool descriptions give the full path to aside | ✅ the server fills `{{DONE_COMMAND}}` with the path of its own executable | `internal/mcp/server.go:243-250`, `72`; `SKILL.md:167-169` |
| D7: without the MCP server, `aside` must be on `PATH` | ✅ the CLI fallback names bare `aside …` commands, and the skill's only source for the full path is the MCP tool descriptions | `SKILL.md:26-28`, `SKILL.md:167-169` |
| The skill names the full path in the "done" step, the Windows form, "Updating all jots" and the rules | ✅ | `SKILL.md:59`, `:91`, `:147`, `:167` |
| The README already says the skill "needs the MCP server above" | ✅ the README edit in Shape changes it to match D7 | `README.md:225` |

## Out of scope

- Bundling the binary, hook and MCP server into the plugin (D4): #113.
- A Codex plugin, a Cursor plugin, and claude.ai account skills for Cowork and the phone (D2): separate issues if anyone asks.
- Changes to the skill beyond D7's clause, to `aside setup`, or to the release archive.
- Running `claude plugin validate` in CI.

## Risks

- **A few seconds with no tag.** Merging the release PR moves the entry's `ref` to the new tag before release-please creates it, so an install in that gap fails until the tag exists.
- **The minimum version is raised by hand.** If a skill change needs a newer binary and the PR doesn't raise it, the plugin can tell an agent to use a command the user's binary lacks. Reviewers of skill PRs need to check it.
- **The Windows form without the MCP server.** The skill picks the Windows form from the full path to aside; without one it falls back to the shell, which is a new rule for the skill and needs a Windows test.
- **Two copies of the skill.** Someone who copied the skill by hand and then installs the plugin has both `aside` and `aside:aside`, which can drift apart. The README tells them to remove the hand copy.
- **`--strict` validation of the plugin directory fails on the repo's `CLAUDE.md`.** It's a warning only, and Claude Code loads the plugin; it matters if strict validation is added to CI later.
- **The whole repo is installed.** About 1.3 MB today; it grows with the repo. A plugin subfolder would avoid it, but it's not worth doing at this size.
- **Skill fixes wait for a release.** A skill change merged to main reaches plugin users, new or existing, only at the next release (D5, D8), so a skill-only fix needs a release to ship.
- **Manual copies don't update.** Codex users and anyone else on the copy path keep the version they copied until they copy it again.
